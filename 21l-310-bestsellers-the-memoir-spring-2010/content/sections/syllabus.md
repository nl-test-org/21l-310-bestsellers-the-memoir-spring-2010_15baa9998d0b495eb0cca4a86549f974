Course Description
------------------

What is a "life" when it's written down? How does memory inform the present? Why are memoirs so popular? This course will address these questions and others, considering the relationship between biography, autobiography, and memoir and between personal and social themes. We will closely examine some recent memoirs: Tobias Wolff's _This Boy's Life_, Barack Obama's _Dreams From My Father_, Edwidge Danticat's _Brother_, _I'm Dying_, Ayaan Hirsi Ali's _Infidel,_ and Alison Bechdel's _Fun Home_. Students will write two brief papers: a critical essay and an experiment in memoir.

As a "Sampling," this class offers 6 units, with a strong emphasis on close reading, group discussion, focused writing, and research and presentation skills.

Course Requirements
-------------------

### Class Format

*   Attendance at all classes is required except in cases of family or medical emergency. Students must account for any absence by contacting the instructor immediately. Repeated absences will directly lower the final grade for the class.
*   Written work should be handed in at the beginning of class on the day assigned. Text should be double-spaced, with standard margins (1.25" each side) and font sizes (12 pt), should include a title, and should supply a Works Cited page (if appropriate), quotations, and citations.
*   Each student will choose a topic and prepare a ten-minute oral presentation to the class. The report should include a brief handout with pertinent information, discussion questions, and a bibliography of authoritative sources. After the in-class presentation, each student will submit a brief (2-page) version of the talk with correct bibliography and a statement of how the material relates to themes in the text under discussion. Each report will be graded on the quality of the information and sources; the effectiveness of delivery and discussion questions; and the correct use of bibliographical format.
